# design-teardown

In this project I will create a copy of the website "Smashing Magazine" where I will analyse where they want to focus my attention and according to that color the different elements in Greyscale. The result will be a heatmap which shows where the designers want to focus our attention. 

The goal for this exercise is to start training myself to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.
